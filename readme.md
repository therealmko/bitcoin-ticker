## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

To build your own Satoshi Radio Ticker, you'll need:

- [Raspberry Pi Pico 2 WH](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2-w?variant=54852253024635)
- [Pimoroni Display Pack 2.8](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack-2-8?variant=42047194005587) (or 2.0)
- 3D printed case (files provided in this repo under "assets")
- 4x M2 x 5mm bolts
- Laser cut acrylic (files provided in this repo under "assets")
- [Angled Micro USB cable](https://www.amazon.nl/PremiumCord-USB-verbindingskabel-datakabel-ku2m1f-90/dp/B07NSQ5859)

## 🔥 Quickstart

### Hardeware setup
1. Download the latest `satoshi_radio_ticker.uf2` file from the releases section.
2. Connect your Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W to your computer while holding the BOOTSEL button.
3. When the Pico appears as a USB drive on your computer, release the button.
4. Drag and drop the `satoshi_radio_ticker.uf2` file onto the Pico drive.
5. The Pico will automatically disconnect, reboot, and start running the ticker software.
6. Print the 3D enclosure files from the "assets" folder.
7. Carefully place the Pico in the enclosure and secure it with the four M2 x 5mm screws.
8. Connect the Pimoroni Display Pack to the Pico, ensuring correct alignment of pins (don't press too hard).
9. Power the Pico with a Micro USB cable to test if the display and data fetching work correctly.
10. Once everything is working, add the laser-cut acrylic top screen to complete the build.

### Network Setup
1. Power on the ticker.
2. When the setup screen appears, connect to the ticker's WiFi network. Use the SSID (SR_Ticker) and password displayed on the screen to connect from your phone or laptop.
3. After connecting, either scan the QR code or enter the IP address shown on the screen into your web browser.
4. Enter your local network credentials (SSID and password) and click "Add Network."
5. Optional: Select which applets (screens) you want to display. If you make any changes to the applets, be sure to click "Save Applets."
6. When you've finished configuration, click "Reboot Device."
7. If the ticker becomes unresponsive during reboot, perform a hard reboot by disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable.

### Pro-tips
- To access the Settings page after initial setup, simply browse to the ticker's IP address on your local network. There's no need to connect directly to the ticker.
- You can add multiple WiFi networks! This makes it convenient to connect the ticker to both your home network and your phone's hotspot.
- You can fork the code and add your own customizations! After you're done, just use the makefile to upload your modified code to the Pi. See the development section below for details.
- Need to reset the Raspberry Pi? There is a whole in the enclosure. Just use a paperclip, you can easily reach the BOOTSEL button.

## 🖨️ 3D Print Instructions
You can print the enclosure yourself! It's straightforward. Choose between the 2.0" or 2.8" version, using the STL files provided in the assets folder. For the 2.8" version, we've also included a 3MF file that you can import into your preferred 3D printing software. This file features our Satoshi Radio Logo. The print settings I used are listed below, but feel free to experiment with your own settings.

### Print Settings
- Layer Height: 0.20mm (standard)
- Outer Wall Speed: 100mm/s
- Supports: Enabled
- Cooling: Disabled for first 3 layers
- Material: ESUN E-PLA+ Matte

### Laser Cutting Instructions
The most difficult part to complete at home. All necessary files and measurements are available in the assets folder. My recommendation is to locate a laser cutting service in your area or place an order online. You'll need translucent black acrylic with 3mm thickness. While the sticker adds a nice finishing touch, it's optional rather than required.

## 🔨 Physical Assembly

1. 3D print the case (004_CASE_TICKER_PICO_2.8).
2. Mount the Raspberry Pi Pico W in the case using the four M2 x 5mm bolts.
3. Attach the Pimoroni Display Pack to the Pico.
4. Apply the double-sided tape (005_TAPE_TICKER_PICO_2.8) to secure the display.
5. Place the vinyl sticker (003_VINYL_TICKER_PICO_2.8) over the front frame.
6. Add the acrylic cover (002_ACRYL_TICKER_PICO_2.8) to complete the assembly.

Refer to the exploded view diagram in the repository for detailed assembly guidance.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Resetting the Pico

If you need to reset your Pico W:
